  <h2>The History</h2>
	<p> On October 12, 1872, Jesup Wakeman Scott founded The University of Toledo as a private arts and trades school known as Toledo University of Arts and Trades, offering painting and architectural drawing as its only subjects. Scott, the editor for The Toledo Blade newspaper from 1844 to 1847, was a public-spirited Toledoan who felt the city should have a university to train young people for responsible positions in the growing community. Scott's dream led him to endow 160-acres of land which later became Scott Park Campus. Scott intended that the income from the property be supplemented with funds from the city to establish a university, but in 1874 the city had no money to contribute..On July 1, 1967, The University was given the status of a state-funded university by the Ohio General Assembly and became known as The University of Toledo. The University of Toledo has since grown to house 8 colleges, a student population of 20,000, and four campuses on more than 450 acres of land. On July 1, 2006, The University of Toledo merged with the Medical University of Ohio. The newly merged institution remained known as The University of Toledo.</p>

	<h2>The Co-op Program</h2>
	<p>The University of Toledo has one of a strongest Engineering Co-op programs in the nation. It is one of eight universities in the nation with a mandatory Co-op program. Each student enrolled in the Engineering college is required to complete a minimum of three cooperative work experiences. Each work experience is one semester (16 weeks) long with full-time pay. The students work in their major fields and gain terrific hands-on experience. The first Co-op is usually in the Spring or Summer semester of the sophomore year. In addition, students graduating from cooperative education programs have an easier time finding their first job. Students also report significantly more job advancements of all types. Students from both the Computer Science and Engineering and the Electrical Engineering programs have accepted positions locally, in various states, and in foreign countries.</p>
