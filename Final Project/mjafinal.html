  <h2>About Marcus</h2>
	<p>Hello World!  My name is Marcus Anderson, and I am a senior attending the University of Toledo studying Computer Science and Engineering Technology. Some of my favorite hobbies include: Doing coding projects, reading, playing video games, bowling, volunteering, and having a good time with friends and family.  I am set to graduate this Fall 2017, and I am greatly looking forward towards the journey that I face after graduation!</p>
<h2>My Time at the University of Toledo</h2>
	<p>My time at the University of Toledo has not only been educational, but also extremely fun and exciting.  The university offers an enormous amount of opportunities for students to get more involved on and off campus, and I wasted no time taking advantage of them.  I joined a wide variety of clubs such as: honor societies, engineering organizations, student government, the university’s student grievance council, and even a fraternity!  These organizations allowed me to take multiple leadership positions that have made me the person that I am today.</p>
  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <p>So, what’s after graduation?  Well, thanks to the University of Toledo’s amazing co-op program that they offer to all engineering students, I was able to obtain a job at a company I previously worked with over the summer, Nationwide Insurance.  I will be working as an IT Application Developer, where I will be creating and fixing functionalities for the company’s insurance applications. I am extremely excited to start my career at such an established company that helps better others lives each and every day.</p>
