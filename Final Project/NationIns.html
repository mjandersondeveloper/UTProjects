  <h2>The History</h2>
	<p> Over the last 85 years, Nationwide has grown from a small mutual auto insurer owned by policyholders to one of the largest insurance and financial services companies in the world, with more than $158 billion in statutory assets.  Early growth came from working together with Farm Bureaus that sponsored the company. Nine Farm Bureaus continue to promote Nationwide.  In 1925, Murray D. Lincoln, the leader with the longest tenure in the company's history, had a leading role in the company's formation. The Ohio Farm Bureau Federation incorporates the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company with the goal of providing quality auto insurance at low rates for farmers in Ohio.  In today's world, We’re still owned by policyholders, but we protect a lot more than just autos owned by Ohio farmers. We’re a Fortune 100 company that offers a full range of insurance and financial services across the country.</p>
